## Contribution
1. We propose a neural network with superior option pricing performance.
2. We evaluate our method against several baselines on a large scale dataset: it includes 5139 trading days and 3029327 option contracts â€“ this is 70 times larger than previous studies (Dugas et al. 2000; Gradojevic, Gencay, and Kukolj 2009). 
3. Our neural network model is meaningful in that it enforces all the necessary requirements for an economically valid (no arbitrage) call option pricing model.




## Strengthness
[as contribution]
* enforce some economic principles
* first learning based approach to carry a valid risk neutral density function


# Future Work
* on high-frequency data
* other problems: eg. implied volatility surface
