## Contribution
* use RL
* has simplified code at the appendix


## Weakness
* outperform BS, but didn't outperform NN


## Future Work
* More input variable eg. (How to measure volatility: This could be based on a historic moving average, a GARCH-model estimate, or even implied volatility from options market data
* ensemble 
* expanding from one dimensional first order approximation to multidimensional higher order ap- proximation of the hedging portfolio????
