# Option Pricing Using Artificial Neural Networks: An Australian Perspective
> 2013 Dissertation
>> Empirical Contribution

## Worth to read
* 2.5 Financial Applications of Machine Learning
* 2.5.1 Option Pricing
* 2.5.2 Volatility Modelling
* 5.1 Summary of Results and Implications for the Hypotheses
* 5.2 Contributions
* 5.3 Future Research


## Conclusion
1. ANNs can forecast volatility more accurately than traditional models (with limitations)
2. Option prices based on ANN models outperform those generated using a traditional pricing model with respect to market prices



## Strengthness
* Real Data from Australian
* Contribution on Volatility Forecast


## Weakness
* No theorectical improvement/backup
* Generalization of this particular dataset into other option pricing?



## Future research
[I only list a few, there are more in chap 5.3]
* Assumption: risk-free rate, so what is a proxy of risk-free rate
* They use Matlab, if using python/deep, can it be better?
* input variable
* meta-learning


## Extension Reading
* What's meta-learning? [知乎link](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/28639662)
