## Abstract
Today, generalized linear models (GLM) are the standard methods in pricing of non-life insurance products. However they require detailed knowledge about the structure of the data, which needs to be provided a priori by the pricing actuary. In this thesis, we present more flexible tree-based methods, that do not suffer from this drawback. In the first part, we discuss their theoretical properties. In the second part, we apply the methods to the problem of predicting the claims frequency of a policyholder. The empirical analysis is based on the Motor Insurance Collision Data Set of AXA Winterthur. We conclude that the regression tree methodology provides a useful tool for building homogeneous subportfolios with similar risk characteristics. The more advanced tree ensemble methods such as bagging and random forest provide competitive alternatives to GLM models in terms of predictive capacity.

## Point
* Why? GLM is traditional methods in pricing of non-life insurance products but they need prior
* Goal: Predict auto claim frequency
* Data: Motor Insurance Collision Data Set of AXA Winterthur
