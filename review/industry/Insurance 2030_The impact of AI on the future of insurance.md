## Four AI-related trends shaping insurance
1. Explosion of data from connected devices
2. Increased prevalence of physical robotics
3. Open source and data ecosystems
4. Advances in cognitive technologies

## The state of insurance in 2030
The experience of purchasing insurance is faster, with less active involvement on the part of the insurer and the customer. Enough information is known about individual behavior, with AI algorithms creating risk profiles, so that cycle times for completing the purchase of an auto, commercial, or life policy will be reduced to minutes or even seconds. Auto and home carriers have enabled instant quotes for some time but will continue to refine their ability to issue policies immediately to a wider range of customers as telematics and in-home Internet of Things (IoT) devices proliferate and pricing algorithms mature. Many life carriers are experimenting with simplified issue products, but most are restricted to only the healthiest applicants and are priced higher than a comparable fully underwritten product. As AI permeates life underwriting and carriers are able to identify risk in a much more granular and sophisticated way, we will see a new wave of mass-market instant issue products.

### Underwriting and pricing
In 2030, manual underwriting ceases to exist for most personal and small-business products across life and property and casualty insurance. The process of underwriting is reduced to a few seconds as the majority of underwriting is automated and supported by a combination of machine and deep learning models built within the technology stack. These models are powered by internal data as well as a broad set of external data accessed through application programming interfaces and outside data and analytics providers. Information collected from devices provided by mainline carriers, reinsurers, product manufacturers, and product distributors is aggregated in a variety of data repositories and data streams. These information sources enable insurers to make ex ante decisions regarding underwriting and pricing, enabling proactive outreach with a bindable quote for a product bundle tailored to the buyer’s risk profile and coverage needs.
Regulators review AI-enabled, machine learning–based models, a task that requires a transparent method for determining traceability of a score (similar to the rating factor derivations used today with regression-based coefficients). To verify that data usage is appropriate for marketing and underwriting, regulators assess a combination of model inputs. They also develop test policies for providers when determining rates in online plans to ensure the algorithm results are within approved bounds. Public policy considerations limit access to certain sensitive and predictive data (such as health and genetic information) that would decrease underwriting and pricing flexibility and increase antiselection risk in some segments.
Price remains central in consumer decision making, but carriers innovate to diminish competition purely on price. Sophisticated proprietary platforms connect customers and insurers and offer customers differentiated experiences, features, and value. In some segments, price competition intensifies, and razor-thin margins are the norm, while in other segments, unique insurance offerings enable margin expansion and differentiation. In jurisdictions where change is embraced, the pace of pricing innovation is rapid. Pricing is available in real time based on usage and a dynamic, data-rich assessment of risk, empowering consumers to make decisions about how their actions influence coverage, insurability, and pricing.


### Claims
- Claims for personal lines and small-business insurance are largely automated

- Claims organizations increase their focus on risk monitoring, prevention, and mitigation.

## How insurers can prepare for accelerating changes
1. Get smart on AI-related technologies and trends
2. Develop and begin implementation of a coherent strategic plan
3. Create and execute a comprehensive data strategy
4. Create the right talent and technology infrastructure
